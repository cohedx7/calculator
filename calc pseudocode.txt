Calculator Project:

Step 5:

save firstValue to be used in later operation after clicking an 
operator sign (except equal)...

depending operator sign clicked, assign operator value accordingly 
(+, -, *, /).

after operator sign is clicked, display should change...

when equal sign gets clicked after second value is inputted, 
secondValue is saved, and operate function is run with the 3 values 
inputted accordingly.

output-result is displayed accordingly...

how to go from clicking an operator symbol and not showing blank screen to inputting secondNum?

if (firstNum has not been assigned)
	run usual code...
else if (firstNum has been assigned)
	clear display + immediately input new numbers into...
	once equal sign is hit, run operate function

---

Step 6:

try using if-else statements for each operation case... for example:
case '+':
	if previous statement is not empty or contains equal sign
		then run operate function (and other stuff like equal operator)
	else run previously written code...

this should ensure that operations with numbers inserted previously work as designed...
