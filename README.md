Step 3 from TOP done, pretty straightforward.
Step 4 is tricky, I'm getting stuck on how to get the values from button into the output-text field...
Got step 4 to work more or less, but will need a while to think about step 5...
I've written some pseudocode for the logic of step 5, but the code isn't working properly... will look at it later tonight or tomo...

Well, I've gotten the calculator to work partially... the only thing is that it displays a blank whenever I click one of the operation symbols... not sure yet how to make it so that the firstNum gets wiped and only secondNum digits show up after hitting the operator symbol...
Also, need to improve functionality as there are some bugs (as stated in Step 6)...
