Step 3 from TOP done, pretty straightforward.
Step 4 is tricky, I'm getting stuck on how to get the values from button into the output-text field...
Got step 4 to work more or less, but will need a while to think about step 5...
I've written some pseudocode for the logic of step 5, but the code isn't working properly... will look at it later tonight or tomo...

[Night]

Well, I've gotten the calculator to work partially... the only thing is that it displays a blank whenever I click one of the operation symbols... not sure yet how to make it so that the firstNum gets wiped and only secondNum digits show up after hitting the operator symbol...
Also, need to improve functionality as there are some bugs (as stated in Step 6)...

Well, I sort of got it to work by splitting the display to output 2 lines - a previous output (with the previous numbers and operation + equal symbol), along with a current output (with the current input or result of operation).

For now, it's somewhat satisfactory, although it might need some working on for improved functionality... look into step 6 to finish the project (preferably by Tuesday of next week)...

I got most of step 6 done today, now the calculator works properly when using operator symbols (even one after the other). It displays "NaN" when two operator symbols are clicked in succession... then, when the '=' symbol is hit repeatedly, it displays "0 + " the currently inputted value... ideally, it would just display the current value and that's it, haven't figured this out yet...

Updated borders and background colors as well.
