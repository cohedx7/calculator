Step 3 from TOP done, pretty straightforward.
Step 4 is tricky, I'm getting stuck on how to get the values from button into the output-text field...
Got step 4 to work more or less, but will need a while to think about step 5...
I've written some pseudocode for the logic of step 5, but the code isn't working properly... will look at it later tonight or tomo...
